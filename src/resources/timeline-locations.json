The village owes most of its great houses and particular architecture to its first aristocrats, and mostly Americans from south of the Mason–Dixon line. After having great WiFi at the local library and walking along the seaside we decided to make our dinner. Little did we know that the van's batteries were not strong enough to power our tiny litle hotplate. We tried everything in desperation, including trying to fix our solar panel. Eventually we scavenged and found a small power plug outside the tourist information center. We gathered around our pan in the cold outdoors like two hobbits. The state of confusion of tourists as they tried to enter the building and was met with two master chefs was a surprise for sure.",
