#Happy Giraffe Website
This is the Happy Giraffe Repository. All website related code is deployed here and linked with Netlify (hosting platform). This website has been created using Vue.js

The website contains some small projects and blogs that I have written:

##TV Show Rater
graphtv was a website which was able to display show chart ratings of individual episodes for tv series. It was a great tool to see the trends of a tv show across seasons and often helped me decide which shows to start or stop watching. The website stopped running that service so I created my own version that queries IMDB records for ratings and displays a similar style chart.
